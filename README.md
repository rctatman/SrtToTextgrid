# SrtToTextgrid
Python script to convert .srt subtitle files to Praat .textgrid files. It's general enough that it *may* work on other types of files like .sub or .sbv, but please be cautious.

~~Written in Python 2.7.3, may not work in Python 3.~~

Written originally in Python 2.7.3, does work in Python 3 (3.8.13)

Example files:

1. a .srt file based on a Youtube transcription of Katie Bell's keynote at a 2015 meeting of the New Zealand Python User Group. Url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj9RR4BSqvM It's almost an hour, so the audio is really too big to upload. 

2. a .srt file from Late Night with Seth Meyers. Url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OozvkPVI7LI

Two files are included to demonstrate the script iterating over .srt files in a given folder.
