And, of course,
the mystery remains.

I know you've all been
thinking about it --

00:00:07,773 --> 00:00:09,008
the tiny door.

6
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,044
What is it?
How'd it get there?

7
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,047
Why would an architect build
a door of that size

8
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,415
into an otherwise
normal-size house?

9
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,484
Or maybe it is
a normal-size door

Or maybe, you guys, maybe,

it's a Malkovich door.

14

I won't confirm or deny,
but let's just say

00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:28,961
if you ever tune
in and see John Malkovich

And, hey, while
you're speculating

27
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,954
about what's behind that door,
the president is speculating

28

about an unproven medical
treatment for coronavirus

29

about the threat of a pandemic.

[ Suspenseful theme plays ]

00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,338
Seems like, almost every day,
we get more and more evidence

34
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,974
that the Trump administration
knew well in advance

35
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,310
of the very real threat
of a pandemic

36
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,778
and that they both ignored it

37

and lied to the
American people about it,

38
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:23,049

that the president

of this proportion.

something, Peter,

that you can never really
think is going to happen.

of 400,000 cases.

New Zealand had a huge advantage

on the Spanish flu.

Of course, no one writes
about that, do they?

So, I think I know
what happened here.

142

Trump knows there was
a movie called "1917."

143

He thought those guys
looked kinda sick

144

and just assumed it was
about the Spanish flu.

145
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,983
Of course, they're not sick,
they're just British,

which Trump would know, if he
hadn't turned off the movie

to watch "Rugrats."

148
00:05:20,886 --> 00:05:23,188
And, yet, despite Trump's
repeated claims

149

that no one could've
foreseen this,

150

Including people
in the Trump administration.

152

Here's just a quick list.

153
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:32,665
First, Obama officials
walked Trump aides

154
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,601
through a global pandemic
exercise in 2017.

155
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,104
Then, in 2017 and 2018,

threat assessment
intelligence analysts

157
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,574
even mentioned a close cousin
of coronavirus by name,

158

saying it had
pandemic potential.

159
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,578
Then, in 2018,

160
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,780
the director for medical
and biodefense preparedness

161
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,349
at the National Security Council
told a symposium

162
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,817
that the threat of pandemic flu

163
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,952
is our number one
health security concern.

164
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:56,655
Then, top administration
officials said last year

165
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:59,325
that the threat of a pandemic
kept them up at night.

166
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,593
Then, White House
economists warned,

167
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:04,497
in 2019, a pandemic
could devastate America.

168
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:08,401
Then, intelligence reports
warned of coronavirus crises

169
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:12,305
as early as November; and then,
U.S. intelligence reports

170
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,341
from January and February warned
about a likely pandemic.

171
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,776
Well, you know the old saying,

172
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:19,845
"Eight strikes and you're out."

173
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:23,449
Seriously, how many incredibly
specific warnings do you need?

a note that says,

"I know what you did
last summer.

you hit a man with your car

to hide the body
and pretend it never happened.

in the sand and ignore reality,

don't know what day it is.

The only thing refreshing here

is the Kool-Aid you drank.

Anyway,
after all those warnings,

228

on Tuesday, we found out
about yet another warning,

229
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:20,933
when it was reported
that Trump's trade advisor

230
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,602
warned the White House
in January

231
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,203
of the risks of a pandemic.

232
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,904
And, at the top
of the document he wrote,

233
00:08:25,904 --> 00:08:28,140
it literally says
"Memorandum to president."

234
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,474
Of course Trump has probably

235
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:31,444
never even heard the word
memorandum before.

236
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,544

I can't read it.

It's in Latin.

So, they knew,
and they lied to you.

240
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:39,452
They told you it wasn't
a threat, but they knew, it was,

241
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,454
and they put lives at risk,
not to mention

242
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,522
all the economic carnage
they knew was coming.

243
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:45,024
They knew.

00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,192
Here's another part
of the problem.

when Trump wanted

to speak more substantively
about China,

284
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:12,878
he gave Kushner a summary
of his views

285

and then asked him
to do some research.

286

Kushner simply went on Amazon,
where he was struck

287
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,518
by the title of one book,
"Death by China,"

co-authored by Peter Navarro.

those concerns aside.

by his tone of voice?

345
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:30,081
I feel like he just pulled up
in a windowless white van

346
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:31,583
across from a high school.

[ As Trump, hushed ]
Hey, kids,

348
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,354
I got some hydroxychloroquine.

349
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,457
It'll make you feel sky-high.

350
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,692
Try it, if you like.

351
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:43,328
Also, there's heart stuff.

352
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:46,131
Trump is desperately hoping
this will all just go away

353
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:49,200
and that's why he's pushing
an unproven miracle cure.

354
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,037
This morning he tweeted that,
once this deadly pandemic

355
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,772
that cratered
our economy is over,

356
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,140
it must be quickly forgotten.

357
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,542
But it shouldn't be forgotten.

358
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,677
Our government,
led by our sociopath president,

359
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,680
ignored repeated warnings
that a major public health

360
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,682
and economic disaster
was headed our way.

361
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,485
And, if you point that out
to Trump and his supporters,

362
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,487
the best they can
counter with is...

363
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,722
-Heh. Touché.
